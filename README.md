# Bank-Loan-Analysis-

Bank Loan Analysis is the process of evaluating loan data to assess borrower risks and repayment patterns, helping banks make informed lending decisions. Using Power BI, the analysis involves cleaning and transforming data to distinguish between good and bad loans, while creating interactive dashboards to track loan approvals, repayments, and borrower risks. It also includes analyzing financial metrics such as the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio, loan defaults, and repayment trends. 
This analysis aids in identifying high-risk borrowers, reducing loan defaults, and improving financial risk management by providing clear, visual insights that support better lending decisions.
